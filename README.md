This is my personal gentoo low bloat kernel config.
It's specific to my hardware: AMD CPU/GPU and my ASUS motherboard.
Don't expect it to work for you.

Recently:
- Added switch controller support
- Added a bunch of extra sensors
- Added support for python jit (speed up portage)
- Switch from legacy EFIFB to more modern SIMPLEFB
